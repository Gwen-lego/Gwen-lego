- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gwen-lego. <br />

- 👀 I’m interested in creating the future. <br />
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development via books, video and ressources found online. <br />
    I now have a strong understanding of Html and CSS and practice everyday doing challenges and replicating websites.
    June 1st, I started learning JavaScript and look forward to achieve my first challenge.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can help me to learn.<br />
- 📫 How to reach me send me an email gwenael.morin@protonmail.com <br />
